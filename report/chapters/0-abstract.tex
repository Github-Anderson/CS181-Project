\begin{abstract}
Halma is a famous chess board game invented in 19th century. Its relatively simple rule and fascinating strategic depth make Halma popular accross the world. In this project, we deploy several Halma gaming agents using the knowledge and technique in CS181. We also try to modify the rule and to see if there is any interesting finding. We practice what we've learned in class, implement them in gaming application and demonstrate AI's magic and intelligence in real world.
