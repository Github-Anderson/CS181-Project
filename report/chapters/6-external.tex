In this project, the GUI and framework are based on \url{https://github.com/indrafnugroho/halma}. We modify the code engineering to support using multiple agents conveniently and \texttt{classic} \& \texttt{score} two modes. 

Figure~\ref{fig:halma} is a screenshot of the game GUI in our project. Figure~\ref{fig:mcts} is borrowed from \href{https://paperswithcode.com/method/monte-carlo-tree-search} {\texttt{Paperwithcode}}. Pseudocode~\ref{alg:dqn} is borrowed and slightly modified from the pseudocode in the original DQN paper\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/MnihKSGAWR13}

The training for Neural Approximate Q-Leaning agent support \texttt{torch} and \texttt{CUDA}. The Figure~\ref{fig:sente}~\ref{fig:gote}~\ref{fig:heatmap}~\ref{fig:jump} are plotted with \texttt{Matplotlib}.
